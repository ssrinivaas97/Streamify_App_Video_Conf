# Streamify â€” Language Exchange (Chat + Video)

A production-ready language exchange platform where users can **chat in real time** and **jump into 1:1 or group video calls** to practice speaking. It includes onboarding, friends/requests, notifications, typing indicators, reactions, threads, image uploads, and multi-theme UI.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Real-time chat**: messages, typing indicators, reactions, threads, image uploads (via Stream Chat).
- **Video calls**: 1:1 & group calls with screen share, reactions, and recording (via Stream Video).
- **Auth + security**: JWT auth stored in HTTP-only cookies, password hashing with bcrypt.
- **Onboarding gate**: Users must complete profile (bio, languages, location) before accessing chat.
- **Friends system**: Send/accept requests; online presence.
- **Modern UI**: React + Vite with 32 themes and clean component patterns.
- **Production-style backend**: Express + MongoDB (Mongoose), layered routes/controllers/models.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TanStack Query, custom hooks.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, dotenv, cookie auth.
- **Realtime/Video**: Stream (Chat & Video SDKs).
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.
- **Tooling**: Nodemon, Postman (for API testing).

## ðŸ§© Key Features â†’ How theyâ€™re built

- **Realtime Chat UI** â†’ Stream Chat SDK (threads, reactions, typing status, presence).
- **Video Calling** â†’ Stream Video (1:1/group, screen share, reactions, recordings).
- **Auth** â†’ JWT issued on signup/login, sent as HTTP-only cookie; protected routes middleware.
- **Password Security** â†’ bcrypt pre-save hash in Mongoose model.
- **Onboarding Flow** â†’ `isOnboarded` flag; router guards redirect to onboarding until complete.
- **Friends** â†’ `friends: [ObjectId]` on User; request/accept flows.
